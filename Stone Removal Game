/*Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with Alice going first.

    Alice starts by removing exactly 10 stones on her first turn.
    For each subsequent turn, each player removes exactly 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer n, return true if Alice wins the game and false otherwise.*/
